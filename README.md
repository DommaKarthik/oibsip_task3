# ATM INTERFACE

Oasis Infobyte Java Task-3

We all have come across many ATMs in our areas.I have designed an ATM by using Java Programming. This complex project consists of five different functions and it is a console-based application. When the system starts the user is prompted with user Login credentials. On entering the details successfully, then ATM functionalities are unlocked. The project allows to perform following operations: 1)Withdraw 2)Deposit 3)Transfer 4)Check Balance 5)Transaction History.
